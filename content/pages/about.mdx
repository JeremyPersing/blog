Hey, I'm Jeremy. I currently work as an Analytics Consultant, a fancy way of saying Power BI Data Analyst. On this blog you will find articles relating to
data and Power BI, but this will also be a place where I write book reviews, and write on things that interest me.

## What's the point of blogging?

- Writing down ideas, reviews, and stories helps consolidate information better in my mind.
- This blog gives me a spot to publish writings and maybe even help people who stumble upon them.
- Writing is a critical skill for any individual, especially one in a corporate role. This blog helps me develop that "writing muscle".
