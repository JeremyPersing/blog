## Too Good to be True

### Current Financial Performance

When first looking at the financial performance of Evolution, I had to question whether their performance was fake or using some sort of accounting gimmickery.
Prior to 2020, the company was averaging more than 40% returns on their invested capital year over year, and since COVID they've been able to average about 20 to 25%.
Their revenue, earnings, and free cash flow have been growing at double digit rates year over year for the past 5 years. The company has a strong balance sheet with
€4,988,120,000 in total assets to €1,219,907,000 total liabilities, having €663,730,000 in cash & cash equivalents. The company also has incredible profit margins,
with operating margins of 63% and net margins of 57% [Source](https://mb.cision.com/Main/12069/3957229/2714767.pdf). The company is also able to convert its earnings
into cash, and rewards shareholders by engaging in share buybacks (with this depressed stock price), and distributing a dividend equal to 50% of the net annual profit
[Source: Page 6, 1st Paragraph](https://mb.cision.com/Main/12069/3957229/2714767.pdf). All of this is to say that Evolution has extremely attractive numbers for any business,
much less a public corporation. It's able to keep more than half of every Euro it earns, and can generate an extra .25 Euros for every Euro it reinvests.
It currently has a PE of around 18, which is near the historic low for the company.

### Mergers & Acquisitions

This is out of the monopoly playbook. We've seen this most notably in tech companies, but even in companies like the UFC. Evolution has been buying their competition, not for the sake of erasing the competition,
but to fill in the gaps missing within Evolution.

### Financially Competent Management

## What's the Catch

Disgruntled employees.
Regulations.
Money laundering and accepting money from bad actors.
Slowing growth.

## Valuation

At a PE of 18, I think this company is a steal. The market is not favoring it now, but if

## The Future of Gambling & the Future of Society

I think that gambling, betting, and activities like this will become more widespread and legalized in coming years. In general, the American society is moving much more towards the
freedom to choose at the state level, and at this level I think that more and more states will come to allow online gambling. We've seen that election betting has become legalized, weed is now legal in x states,
and online gambling is now legal in x states, which changed in y. The company is also global, and sees opportunities in Asia and Latin America...
